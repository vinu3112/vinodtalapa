Friedman, a somewhat controversial figure owing to some of his past political stances, launched into a talk informed by his most recent book, &#8220;Thank You for Being Late,&#8221; and talked about what we&#8217;re seeing now in human history as a moment of intersection of three different forces accelerating in a &#8220;nonlinear manner&#8221; all at once, including technological development outpacing humanity&#8217;s ability to adapt to those changes.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1846355\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1846355\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1846355\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-from-iOS-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1846355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYT columnist and author Thomas Friedman at True North 2019 in Waterloo.</p></div></p>\n<p>Friedman&#8217;s talk ended with him positing that humans spend most of their time today in the essentially &#8220;god-less&#8221; realm of &#8220;cyberspace,&#8221; a realm &#8220;where we&#8217;re all connected but no one&#8217;s in charge,&#8221; while at the same time we&#8217;ve achieved better than ever ability to act with god-like power to control and manipulate our environment. He chided the essential disconnect of powerful forces that act with supreme mastery over technology but with no grounding in sociopolitical understanding (specifically naming <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mark-zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and those who have the inverse problem (the U.S. Congress, in Friedman&#8217;s view).</p>\n<p>Overall, Friedman&#8217;s views are grounded in what he describes as a place of optimism. But the takeaway is more that humanity is currently at a state where it&#8217;s overwhelmed on a number of fronts and out of its depth in terms of having a capacity to cope.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, Robert Mazur (longtime undercover agent and the subject of biopic &#8220;The Infiltrator&#8221;) discussed his experience tracking down and prosecuting money launderers operating more or less with the blessing of large financial institutions, precisely because their systems were designed around incentive systems that encouraged them but didn&#8217;t have protections in place to prevent bad actors from taking advantage. Mazur further elaborated that current telecom industry structure actually makes it even easier than ever to launder large sums relatively unchecked. In essence, it was a warning to be mindful of how the products you build can be exploited by the most malicious actors.</p>\n<p>Former Information and Privacy Commissioner for Ontario and creator of the concept of &#8220;Privacy by Design&#8221; Ann Cavoukian came next, decrying the current state of data &#8220;centralized in huge honeypots of information,&#8221; including <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (her example).</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1846391\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1846391\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1846391\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3A7CF1A-121E-483B-A1AD-55957731447B-49984-00001555A93E8A45.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1846391\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian.</p></div></p>\n<p>This centralization, she noted is a huge risk in terms of presenting opportunities for tracking, misuse, leaks and more.

Overall, it felt introspective, contrite and contemplative &#8212; a self-reflection from a community genuine about shoring up its ethical shortcomings. In other words, refreshing.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/YWd8Bcgl_Cs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","contentSnippet":"From the venue and the flashy event website, Waterloo, Ontario&#8217;s True North conference (in its second year) doesn&","publishedDate":"2019-06-19T20:56:10.000Z","categories":[{"name":"Events"},{"name":"Startups"},{"name":"TC"},{"name":"africa"},{"name":"artificial intelligence"},{"name":"BlackBerry"},{"name":"Buzzfeed"},{"name":"Communitech"},{"name":"encryption"},{"name":"Google"},{"name":"healthcare"},{"name":"kara swisher"},{"name":"Mark Zuckerberg"},{"name":"north america"},{"name":"privacy"},{"name":"re/code"},{"name":"smartphone"},{"name":"sustainable energy"},{"name":"Thomas Friedman"},{"name":"true north"},{"name":"University of Waterloo"},{"name":"waterloo"},{"name":"writers"}],"author":"Darrell Etherington"},{"title":"Video and messaging enable remote work.

Open-plan offices. Work-life balance. Remote work. There are endless ways to set up your team and company for success. And there’s evidence for and against all of these scenarios.</p>\n<p>Take remote work for instance. Owl Labs reports that 44% of global companies don’t allow it. While Gallup reports that 43% of all Americans work remotely at least some of the time.</p>\n<p>So what’s the right answer? Well that depends on what your goals are. But no matter what, the important thing is to make a decision and stick with it.</p>\n<p>Because no matter what decision you’re making – personal, professional, big or small – it’s important to commit 100%. And when that decision is likely to impact your company’s culture for years to come, you better hope to get it right.</p>\n<p>So when <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/buffer\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"buffer\">Buffer’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> co-founder and CEO, Joel Gascoigne, decided to close down one of their offices, I gave him one key piece of advice. Commit to either placing the entire team in the remaining office or establish a 100% remote workforce. Both scenarios can work, but a mix of the two will only set you up to fail.</p>\n<p>When everyone is remote, that becomes one of the defining characteristics of a company’s culture. People have no option but to get their work done and collaborate virtually. And an entirely remote culture can both draw in candidates attracted to this way of working and remove those who know they won’t be able to thrive working remotely.</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/OhJgwOyVR_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","contentSnippet":"\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Cancel\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContributor\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tShare on Twitter\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tDavid Cancel  i","publishedDate":"2019-06-19T17:17:33.000Z","categories":[{"name":"Apps"},{"name":"Column"},{"name":"Personnel"},{"name":"Startups"},{"name":"Talent"},{"name":"TC"},{"name":"Video"},{"name":"aetna"},{"name":"Bank of America"},{"name":"Buffer"},{"name":"cornell university"},{"name":"David Cancel"},{"name":"decentralized work force"},{"name":"Drift"},{"name":"fundera"},{"name":"future of work"},{"name":"IBM"},{"name":"Lookery"},{"name":"messaging"},{"name":"remote work"},{"name":"Remote workers"},{"name":"telecommuting"},{"name":"Wade Foster"},{"name":"zapier"}],"author":"Arman Tabatabai"}]}}});
